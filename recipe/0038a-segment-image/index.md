## Use Case

You wish to select a rectangular part of the image and present it without any surrounding content. Examples are the ability to crop out the depiction of the frame from an image of a painting, or exclude the color calibration target from an image of a page.

This allows a single master image to be used for both usage scenarios of a page turner application that should not render the color bar for a page, and also for a digital conservation or research use case where the target is available.  Similarly, you could pull a small detail from a much larger image such as one item from a large contact sheet, when it is the only representation available of the object.

## Implementation notes

The client should not render the area of the image that is not selected by the annotation.
