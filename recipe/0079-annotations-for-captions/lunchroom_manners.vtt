[music]

2
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.600
Just before lunch one day, a puppet show 
was put on at school.

3
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.500
It was called "Mister Bungle Goes to Lunch".

4
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.500
It was fun to watch.

5
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.300
In the puppet show, Mr. Bungle came to the 
boys' room on his way to lunch.

6
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.200
He looked at his hands. His hands were dirty 
and his hair was messy.

7
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.100
But Mr. Bungle didn't stop to wash his hands 
or comb his hair.

8
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.900
He went right to lunch.

9
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.700
Then, instead of getting into line at the 
lunchroom, Mr. Bungle pushed everyone aside 
and went right to the front.

10
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.800
Even though this made the children laugh, 
no one thought that was a fair thing to do.

11
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:22.000
Then, in the lunchroom, Mr. Bungle was so 
clumsy and impolite that he knocked over 
everything. And no one wanted to sit next 
to him.

12
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.000
And when he finally knocked his own tray 
off the table, that was the end of the puppet 
show.

13
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.300
The children knew that even though Mr. Bungle 
was funny to watch, he wouldn't be much fun 
to eat with.

14
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.500
Phil knew that a Mr. Bungle wouldn't have 
many friends. He wouldn't want to be like 
Mr. Bungle.

15
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.100
Later Miss Brown said it was time to for 
the children who ate in the cafeteria to 
go to lunch.

16
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.500
She hoped there weren't any Mr. Bungles in 
this room.

17
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.200
Phil stopped to return a book to Miss Brown 
while his friends went on to the lunchroom.

18
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.400
He would have to catch up with them later.

19
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.000
One his way to catch up with his friends, 
Phil almost walked passed the boys' room.

20
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.400
But he stopped and thought we're his hands 
clean?

21
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.800
No, they were a little dirty. Phil remembered 
that Mr. Bungle didn't wash his hands.

22
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.600
Mr. Bungle's hair was messy too.

23
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.000
Phil didn't want to be like Mr. Bungle.

24
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.900
Inside the boys' room, Phil was surprised 
to see some of his friends washing their 
hands too.

25
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.900
Phil washed his hands well with lots of soap.

26
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.800
Then he rinsed the soap off.

27
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.900
Phil dried his hands well too. When he was 
finished, he threw the paper towel in the 
basket where it belonged.

28
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.200
And then he made sure that his hair looked 
neat.

29
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.500
Now Phil and his friends were ready for lunch.

30
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.300
There was a line of children waiting to get 
into the lunchroom when Phil got there.

31
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.100
He saw some boys he knew at the front of 
the line.

32
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.600
They waved for him to go up to the front 
with them.

33
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.100
But Phil didn't want to break into line as 
Mr. Bungle did.

34
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.500
So Phil went to the end. That was the fair 
thing to do.

35
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.500
He would see his other friends inside the 
lunchroom.

36
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.500
The line moved very fast, and soon Phil was 
inside.

37
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.200
First he picked up his tray.

38
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.300
Then he got his silverware.

39
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.300
He put his knife, fork and spoon neatly on 
the tray.

40
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.500
And then he slid his tray along.

41
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.300
He always enjoyed looking at the good food 
in the cafeteria.

42
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.200
It tasted good and was good for him too.

43
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.200
Instead of having a sandwich today, Phil 
decided to take the hot lunch.

44
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.300
Phil took some bread and butter too.

45
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.600
And he knew what else he wanted: milk.

46
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.600
But Alice took the last carton on the tray.

47
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.600
Maybe there was more more milk, so he said, 
"May I please have some milk?"

48
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.800
Phil remembered to say "may I" and "please". 
That was very polite.

49
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.200
Yes, there was more milk.

50
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.500
Phil remembered to say "thank you" when he 
took the carton of milk.

51
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.000
Phil had good manners. He didn't want to 
be like Mr. Bungle in the lunchroom.

52
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.400
Phil didn't want to forget his dessert.

53
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.200
The cake looked delicious [and was huge!].

54
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.300
At the end of the line, the lunchroom supervisor 
said she had noticed how polite Phil was.

55
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.000
And she smiled at him.

56
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.400
She wouldn't smile at a Mr. Bungle.

57
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.600
Phil went to table where his friends were.

58
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.700
He put his tray down carefully, pulled out 
his chair quietly and sat down.

59
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.600
He knew his friends would like a noisy Mr. 
Bungle at their table.

60
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.900
There was someone Phil liked: Freddy.

61
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.700
He always brought his lunch from home.

62
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.700
It looked good.

63
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.000
Freddy had a sandwich, and apple, a cookie, 
and milk.

64
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.100
Before Phil began to eat, he always put a 
napkin on his lap.

65
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.900
So did Freddy.

66
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.300
Everyone liked Freddy. He was very polite.

67
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.900
For example, if he had food in his mouth 
when someone talked to him,

68
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.200
he always took time to chew the food with 
his mouth closed and swallow before he answered.

69
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.800
Phil noticed how straight and tall Freddy 
usually sat.

70
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.600
Freddy kept his feet on the floor too.

71
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.500
Phil would rather be like Freddy than like 
Mr. Bungle.

72
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.400
Another polite person everyone liked was 
Alice.

73
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.200
For example, when Alice sneezed, she covered 
her mouth and nose. This protected her friends 
at the table from any germs.

74
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.000
While Phil and his friends ate, a boy ran 
past their table.

75
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.300
You shouldn't run in the lunchroom. Only 
Mr. Bungle would do that.

76
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.400
Phil and his friends wouldn't like to have 
a Mr. Bungle at their table.

77
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.400
Then lunchtime wouldn't be as much fun as 
it is.

78
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.100
Phil ate slowly and enjoyed his lunch.

79
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.400
Finally, he had eaten everything except his 
dessert.

80
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.800
He saved his cake for last.

81
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.900
Only a Mr. Bungle would eat his dessert before 
he'd finished the rest of his lunch.

82
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.200
And Phil wan't a Mr. Bungle.

83
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.000
The cake was a lie.

84
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.300
Phil drank his milk carefully.

85
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.200
Some children are messy when they drink milk, 
but not Phil.

86
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:30.500
As each of Phil's friends finished, they 
didn't leave the table but waited for all 
the others to finish eating too.

87
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.500
Phil was the last one done.

88
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.500
His wiped his mouth and hands carefully with 
his napkin.

89
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.500
Then he cleaned the table where he sat.

90
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.700
He didn't want to leave his place at the 
table dirty.

91
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:52.500
Everyone at the table cleaned his own place 
well. But look at that table. It was left 
very messy.

92
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.500
Phil thought a Mr. Bungle must have sat there.

93
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:04.500
But Phil didn't want to be like Mr. Bungle 
so he put his chair neatly into place.

94
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.600
And his table looked fine.

95
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.500
Not a piece of paper or scrap of food was 
left on it.

96
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.500
No Mr. Bungle sat here!

97
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:26.400
Phil's friends were careful to put their 
waste papers and empty milk cartons where 
they belonged.

98
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.600
In this way, they helped keep the lunchroom 
clean.

99
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:37.700
Phil was certain that Mr. Bungle wouldn't 
put his paper in the waste basket and his 
empty carton on the milk tray.

100
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.600
Mr. Bungle probably wouldn't bother to put 
his lunch tray in the right place either.

101
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.500
But Phil and his friends did.

102
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.500
Lunch was good today. And then Miss Brown 
told Phil and his friends how proud she was 
of them.

103
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.300
They had left their table the neatest in 
the luchroom.

104
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.200
No one here was a Mr. Bungle. And no one 
wanted to be.

105
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:09.200
Are you like Mr. Bungle? Mr. Bungle is ashamed 
because he spoils lunchtime.

106
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.000
Don't be like Mr. Bungle.

107
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.600
Have good lunchtime manners and lunch will 
be more fun for everyone.
