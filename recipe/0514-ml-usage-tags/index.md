## Use Case

Similar to the initiatives crafted by other content communities in efforts to limit the scraping of images and text using “noai” and “noimageai” meta HTML tags, users of the IIIF APIs may consider implementing a set of tags/usage statements their IIIF manifests to help better regulate ML/AI content scraping and non-consented or attributed use of IIIF powered content in ML/AI applications.

## Implementation Notes

Use of these standardized ML/AI Usage tags in IIIF Manifests will always need to be paired with sophisticated, up-to-date DevOps and data security practices within the context of a repository environment.

Recommendation to use a single applicable tag, based on the particular concerns associated with an asset's use in ML/AI applications.

### Using `rights` statement URIs sourced from Wikidata

The examples shown here reference the Wikidata Items URIs for the different statements. As described in the [IIIF Presentation 3.0 `rights` property](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#rights) related to  `@context` requirements, and using the [Profiles Registry](https://iiif.io/api/registry/profiles/), you need to add the specified Profile URI for the Wikidata items to the `context` property at the beginning of your IIIF Manifest:

```JSON
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q115365241",
    "http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json"
  ]
}
```

Please also see the [goals statement on Stable URIs Development and Maintenance in the Ethical ML/AI Usage Tags Project Repository](https://github.com/alliomeria/ethical_ml_usage_tags/blob/main/README.md#stable-uris-development-and-maintenance) for information about the longer term plans regarding related URIs. 

#### For humans, within [`requiredStatement`](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#requiredstatement)

```JSON 
{
  "requiredStatement": {
    "label": { "en": [ "No AI" ] },
    "value": { "en": [ "Material related to this Digital Object should not be used for AI or ML training datasets." ] }
  }
}
```
```JSON
{
  "requiredStatement": {
  "label": { "en": [ "No Image AI" ] },
  "value": { "en": [ "Image-based material related to this Digital Object should not be used for AI or ML training datasets." ] }
  }
}
```
```JSON
{
  "requiredStatement": {
  "label": { "en": [ "Regulated ML/AI Use Permitted - Attribution Required" ] },
  "value": { "en": [ "material related to this Digital Object may be used for AI or ML training datasets, as long as Standard Attribution of source Digital Object Title and URL is maintained and referenced publicly for the ML/AI dataset." ] }
  }
}
```
```JSON
{
  "requiredStatement": {
  "label": { "en": [ "Regulated ML/AI Use Permitted - Consent Required" ] },
  "value": { "en": [ "Material related to this Digital Object may be used for AI or ML training datasets, if Prior Written Consent is obtained from the Source Holding Institution and Standard Attribution is maintained and referenced publicly." ] }
  }
}
```

#### For machines, within [`rights`](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#rights)

* No AI
```JSON
{ "rights": "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q127515163" }

```

* No Image AI
```JSON
{ "rights": "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q127516405" }

```

* Regulated ML/AI Use Permitted - Attribution Required
```JSON
{ "rights": "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q127516763" }

```

* Regulated ML/AI Use Permitted - Consent Required
```JSON
{ "rights": "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q127518037" }

```

#### Additional Considerations

* Simple use cases (apply per manifest) versus complex uses casses (apply per item/canvas)

* IIIF is an API based framework, geared to machine mediated interactions but: **IIIF resources are for humans** 

* As we, professionally and personally, decide to use or integrate ML/AI tools into our repositories, we need to keep in mind our curatorial legacies and the complex nature of our own content.

* ML/AI technology will continue to shift over time and require diligent application and monitoring, for the rest of our professional lives.

## Restrictions

No known restrictions.

## Example

{% include manifest_links.html manifest="manifest.json" %}

{% include jsonviewer.html src="manifest.json" config='data-line="15-28"' %}
