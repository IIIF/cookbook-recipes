title: Geolocate Manifest to a Polygon
id: 195
layout: recipe
tags: [maps, geolocate, annotation]
summary: "Geolocate a Manifest to a Polygonal area on Earth."
---

### Use Case 
There is a photo taken from an event being encoded as a IIIF Presentation API 3.0 Manifest. The Manifest needs to be geolocated to the bounding area of GÃ¶ttingen, Germany where the event ook place.  Unfortunately, the exact Point coordinates are not known.  

### Implementation Notes
* This Manifest extends the Manifest used in the [rights](https://github.com/IIIF/cookbook-recipes/issues/8) recipe. If you have any questions about the Manifest, visit that recipe to learn more.
* The third party [GeoJSON-LD](https://geojson.org/geojson-ld/vocab.html) context is included alongside the IIIF Presentation 3 context. This supplies the vocabulary terms for the GeoJSON-LD Annotation bodies since the IIIF Presentation 3 context does not describe those terms. The field `@context` can be an array, and when it is the Presentation API 3 context must be the last item in the array.  

### Restrictions
Nested GeoJSON coordinate arrays are incompatible with the processing model of JSON-LD 1.0. The JSON-LD 1.1 processing model does not have this restriction.  

### Manifest

{% include jsonviewer.html src="manifest.json" config='data-line="68-123"'  %}
