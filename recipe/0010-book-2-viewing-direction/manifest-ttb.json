  "summary": { "en": ["William Lewis Sachtleben was an American long-distance cyclist who rode across Asia from Istanbul to Peking in 1891 to 1892 with Thomas Gaskell Allen Jr., his classmate from Washington University. This was part of a longer journey that began the day after they had graduated from college, when they travelled to New York and on to Liverpool; in all they travelled 15,044 miles by bicycle, 'the longest continuous land journey ever made around the world' as reported in their book <cite>Across Asia on a bicycle</cite> (1895). Sachtleben documented his travels with photographs and diaries, the latter of which he numbered sequentially. The diary of notebook 'No. 10' covers a portion of their journey through the Armenian area of Turkey from April 12 to May 9 (there is a 2-page reading list at the end). During this time they rode from Ankara (Angora in the diary) to Sivas, where they stayed for ten days while Allen had a bout of typhoid fever, and the first half of a ten-day excursion to Merzifon (Mersovan in the diary), taken by Sachtleben to give Allen additional time to recover."] },
