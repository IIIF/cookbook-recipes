## Use Case

When timed-text (trancscript, caption, OHMS XML files) is available for A/V content, synchronizing the display of the text and the media playback can be accomplished by transforming the timed information into annotations.

## Implementation notes

## Restrictions

When is this pattern is usable / not usable? Is it deprecated? If it uses multiple specifications, which versions are needed, etc.? (Not present if not needed.)

## Example

Describe in prose and provide examples, e.g.:

{% include manifest_links.html viewers="Mirador" manifest="manifest.json" %}
{% include jsonviewer.html src="manifest.json" %}
