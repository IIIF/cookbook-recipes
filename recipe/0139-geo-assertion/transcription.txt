To my dear friend Francois,

Thank you for the dinner invitation to your home in Paris.  I miss Paris greatly and look forward to returning this year.
I have already booked my flight to Roissy Charles de Gaulle and plan to use public transport to reach your home in central Paris.  
Expect me to arrive promptly, I will be hungry.

Sincerely yours,
Bryan
