1
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:10,749
At the fashionable game Canasta.

2
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:14,172
Jacques Fath names this model in blue
velvet "flight of a dove"

3
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:15,363
with green reflections.

4
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:17,792
A braid of the same fabric holds the robe.

5
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,091
Necklace under the diamond collar.

6
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:24,815
Light shades scale in this autumn collection.

7
00:00:24,847 --> 00:00:26,219
White sequence.

8
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:27,662
Satin dress and cloak.

9
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:30,470
At the ball, it is the most imaginative as a line

10
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:33,069
as it narrows to an hourglass on the knee.

11
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:34,536
After the ball.

12
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:38,052
Satin of a tender light blue,
Burgundy red velvet cloak.

13
00:00:40,029 --> 00:00:42,418
Salome, again satin and again white

14
00:00:42,444 --> 00:00:46,039
the fabric and the colour inspire the
Parisian tailor's imagination this time.

15
00:00:46,248 --> 00:00:47,360
Giselle,

16
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:49,978
novel heroine for young girls,
white tulle.

17
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:53,136
The torso and the head emerge
as from a rippled cloud.

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,146
The 7/8 cloak insists on these models.

19
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:59,353
Evening dresses stretched to the ground.

20
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:02,668
But the newer line is what Fath calls "column."

21
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:04,858
We see it in tight-fitting clothes

22
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:08,058
with at the end a brief
commemoration of the trail.
