00:00:08.987 --> 00:00:10.749
At the fashionable game Canasta.

00:00:10.793 --> 00:00:14.172
Jacques Fath names this model in blue
velvet "flight of a dove"

00:00:14.207 --> 00:00:15.363
with green reflections.

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:17.792
A braid of the same fabric holds the robe.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.091
Necklace under the diamond collar.

00:00:22.408 --> 00:00:24.815
Light shades scale in this autumn collection.

00:00:24.847 --> 00:00:26.219
White sequence.

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:27.662
Satin dress and cloak.

00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:30.470
At the ball, it is the most imaginative as a line

00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:33.069
as it narrows to an hourglass on the knee.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:34.536
After the ball.

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:38.052
Satin of a tender light blue,
Burgundy red velvet cloak.

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:42.418
Salome, again satin and again white

00:00:42.444 --> 00:00:46.039
the fabric and the colour inspire the
Parisian tailor's imagination this time.

00:00:46.248 --> 00:00:47.360
Giselle,

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:49.978
novel heroine for young girls,
white tulle.

00:00:50.172 --> 00:00:53.136
The torso and the head emerge
as from a rippled cloud.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.146
The 7/8 cloak insists on these models.

00:00:57.183 --> 00:00:59.353
Evening dresses stretched to the ground.

00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:02.668
But the newer line is what Fath calls "column."

00:01:02.853 --> 00:01:04.858
We see it in tight-fitting clothes

00:01:04.892 --> 00:01:08.058
with at the end a brief
commemoration of the trail.
